Find Your Server's IP Address:

    The GUI Way: Click the top-right corner of the screen (where the network/volume/power icons are). Click on "Wired Connected" or your Wi-Fi network name, then "Wired Settings" or "Wi-Fi Settings". A window will open, and you'll see your IPv4 Address listed (e.g., 192.168.1.105).

    The Terminal Way: In the Terminal, type ip a. Look for the inet address. Write this IP address down.

Connect Remotely from Your Windows PC:

    Now you can put the Linux laptop aside (plugged in, of course).

    On your Windows computer, open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

    Type the command below, using your Linux username and the IP address you just found:
    ssh yourname@192.168.1.105

    Accept the security fingerprint by typing yes, then enter your Linux password. You are now controlling your Linux machine from your Windows PC!
