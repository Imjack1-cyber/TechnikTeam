A comprehensive web application designed to manage a school's event technology crew ("Technik-Team"). The platform provides tools for event planning, user management, inventory tracking, and skill development, all within a granular, permission-based access control system. This version is a complete rewrite using a modern Spring Boot REST API and a React single-page application frontend.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get a local instance of the application running for development.

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven 3.8+
*   Node.js 20+ (with npm)
*   MySQL Server 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+

### 2. Database Setup
1.  Create a new database in your database server:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE technik_team_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
    ```
2.  Create a dedicated database user with privileges on this database.

### 3. Backend Configuration & Setup
1.  Navigate to the project's root directory.
2.  Open `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
3.  Update the `spring.datasource.*` properties to match your database connection details.
4.  Set a strong, unique secret for `jwt.secret`. This is critical for security.
5.  Set the `upload.directory` to an absolute path on your local machine. This directory must exist and be writable by the application.
6.  The application uses Flyway for database migrations. The necessary tables will be created automatically when the application starts for the first time.

### 4. Backend Launch
1.  From the project's root directory, run the Spring Boot application using Maven:
    ```shell
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
2.  The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 5. Frontend Setup & Launch
1.  In a separate terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```shell
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required Node.js dependencies:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the Vite development server:
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The Vite server is configured to proxy all API (`/api`) and WebSocket (`/ws`) requests to the Spring Boot backend running on port 8080.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

*   **Default Admin**: If you used the provided Flyway migration scripts, a default admin user will be created.
    *   **Username**: `admin`
    *   **Password**: `admin123`
*   **API Documentation**: Full, interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/TechnikTeam/swagger-ui.html` once the backend is running.
